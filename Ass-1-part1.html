        <h1>Re: Elieen Dover university application</h1>

        <p> Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part <br>
            of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

        </p>

        <h2> Strating Dates</h2>

        <p>
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
            could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> First semister: <time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li> Second semister: <time datetime="2017-01-15"> 15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li> Third semister: <time datetime="2017-05-02"> 2 May 2017</time></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br>
            You can find more information about <a href="http.//example.com" title="about important university"> important university Dates</a> on our website.

        </p>

        <h3> Subjects of study</h3>

        <p>
            
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
            the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
            by are as follows, in order of priority: <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C <sub>14</sub>H <sub>12</sub>O <sub>3</sub>.) <br> </li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 &times; 10 <sup>4</sup>.) <br> </li>
            <li> <u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores. <br></li>
            </ol>        
        

        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. <br>

        </p>

        <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br>

        </p>

        <p>
            Polynesian chicken dance

        </p>

        <p>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300 a whole village would dance around <br>
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful". <br>
            
        </p>

        <p>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle
        </p>

        <P>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
            modern styles such as Twerking. <br> 
            
        </P>

        <p>
            Arctic robot dance

        </p>

        <p>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
            discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            because they were really cold. <br>

        </p>
